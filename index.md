# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/JacobKnickerbocker/Jacob-Knickerbocker-Profile/blob/main/assets/images/headshot.jpg" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

My name is Jacob Knickerbocker and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Northern Illinois University!

I'm a determined individual who loves to work with others and with technology! My current emphasis is with Enterprise Software with the end goal of developing software and video games using various coding languages and engines!

### Background

I was born in Princeton, Illinois and I became a Huskie at NIU in the Fall of 2024. I'd been researching different universities across the United States but NIU really spoke to me. It was close to home, had an affordable tuition, and had a great computer science program! I made the final decision to commit to NIU and I don't regret it one bit.

Before coming to NIU, I dabbled in programming here and there but my main passion was music. I held a leadership role (Drum Major) in my high school band (Princeton High School) which really helped me connect with others and get more comfortable presenting myself! Performing in front of others, putting everything I had practiced out there for everyone to see, was an experience I wouldn't trade for the world.

When I'm not working on my classwork, I'm usually interacting with friends, programming my own projects (mainly video games), or finding another way to relax!
