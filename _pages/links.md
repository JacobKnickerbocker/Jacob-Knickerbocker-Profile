### GitHub

I have submitted a [pull-request](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/pull/2680) on GitHub at the [Streamich React-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)
but the pull request has not been moved past its current state in quite some time so I don't believe they are going to be accepting it. My pull-request was made in
order to add a brief description to the README.md file so that newcomers could have a better understanding regarding the purpose of the project.
