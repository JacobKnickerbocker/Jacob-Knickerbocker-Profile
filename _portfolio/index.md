  <summary>BP - 1 Discovering Open Source</summary>

### What is ***Open Source?***

Open Source is software that is open to the public and developed collaboratively! Other factors that define Open Source include:

- ***Free*** Redistribution
- Source Code
- **No** Discrimination
- Distribution of License
- Derived Works

### What Surprised *Me*?

I was *personally* surprised by the fact that Open Source projects and software were hoarded from the public at first and seen more as a product to be sold to the public. I'm also impressed by how dedicated some of the volunteers that maintain open source projects! Open source appears in the world more often than we may think!

### Who & What Uses Open Source?

Companies in *almost* every industry make use of open source projects and code, such as *Walmart*, *Microsoft*, and *Verizon*. Some projects that have used Open Source include Linux(And by extension Android), GitHub, and developer kits from many different companies!

### *Why* Does it Matter?

The companies and projects that use Open Source matter because it shows just *how* important it is to the tech world! Due to big companies and largely used projects using Open Source, it ensures that it will remain as an important part of development! It's uses all the time to connect developers from around the world in an organized way, mainly through GitHub, to allow for the collaboration of many individuals at once. Open Source projects and the like will continue to grow with the tech industry and offer opportunities to the world to work together in order to create something truly ground-breaking!

# What have I learned?

### Markdown

- Markdown is a powerful tool that allows many different software and the like to change how text appears
- Markdown is easily editable and can be formatted in many different ways
- Markdown is common and can be seen in many other apps and websites (*Such as Discord*)

### Git

- Git can be used locally to push and pull file changes
- Repos can be cloned to copy the contents of it to a local device (*This is helpful for making separate changes to push to a branch*)
- Git is very effective for version control due to its branches, cloning, and other functions

## How will this help me contribute to open source and improve professionally?

- I can use version control to my advantage to ensure that the project development goes smoothly and any fatal crashes can be fixed by rolling back
- I now know much more about how Git works so I can use it more effectively (Commands, functions, lingo, etc.)
- I can communicate using markdown to make notes and discussions much easier to read

## Have I used them before?

- Briefly used markdown in *Discord*, though it is slightly different compared to the markdown used in GitHub
- Also briefly used Git & GitHub for version control of a video game I was making with a small team (We've now moved on to a different project)

## What surprised me?

- I was surprised at how easy it is to pick up on Git and markdown when the resources are available to you, specifically the git --[insert command here] format
- Git is more widely used than I thought, with thousands upon thousands of projects utilizing the tools provided by Git daily
- I was unaware at how useful some of the discussion features can be since I have never looked into them before

  <summary>BP03 - Explore Open Source Projects</summary>

### How I chose the Repository

- Looked for something that could be useful in different circumstances (In a team or individually)
- Good documentation and organization was present (Specific features were listed and headers were used well)
- Recent activity was also present (Within 9 hours in this case)

### What I Found Interesting

#### Structure

- The master branch is very informative with intuitive names of files and folders (Scripts, .codesandbox)
- Links to outside content are readily available, making it very easy to access any related content (Excalidraw link show on the right hand side)
- The project tab contains a public backlog of versions as well as a roadmap for Excalidraw 

#### Community

- Very constructive and helpful community, especially with bug fixes (Providing help to other members before moderators)
- Feature and pull requests are great suggestions that are worth looking at or adding even in forked versions
- Interactions between community members are very civil and often do not require moderation 

#### Contribution Process

- Guidelines are clearly stated for pull requests (Title specifics and content specifics)
- Two different options are available for contributing (Manual & CodeSandBox)
- Testing is provided after a pull request is submitted to ensure the contribution will merge successfully

  <summary>BP04 - Revealjs</summary>

## The Structure
- The format is very intuitive with clearly labeled files such as their plugins folder
- The contribution guide is brief and straight to the point with specifics clearly outlined (*No merging from master branches for example*)
- Issues and pull requests are handled at a decent pace (*Most recent pull request was about a month ago*)
- The ReadME is very helpful since it briefly provides information about the purpose of Revealjs as well as links to more information

## What It's For
Revealjs is stated to be "an open source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create beautiful presentations for free." This framework can be implemented into other projects since
the code is available for others to use as well. Using nested slides, extensive API, and other features, this can be used as a very powerful tool to create presentations for absolutely free! Plugins are also available
to enhance and customize the user experience. 

## What I Found Interesting
### Documentation
- [x] Concise?
- [x] Clear?
- [x] Easily Accessible?
- [x] Maintained?

### Maintenance
- [x] Recent Pull Request?
- [x] Updated Releases?
- [x] Recent Activity? (About a week ago)

## Would I Contribute to Revealjs?
I don't see myself contributing to this project because it does *not* interest me enough, but it is an interesting project nonetheless! This project definitely is useful and can be used within other project, but I
don't think that I would choose to contribute to this *specific* project. I would like to mention that this repository is well maintained and would be a great one to contribute to if someone is thinking about it!

  <summary>BP05 - Ownership, Access, and Innovation: What I Learned About Licensing</summary>

## Something I Learned about Open Source Licenses
I learned that open source licenses are mainly used to show the consumer which part they are being given and how they can use it. For example, in the MIT licence, you are allowed to use it for *anything* but you have to include the **original** copyright notice
within your project. Difference licenses are used for different reasons but they all ultimately share certain parts with the public in specific ways as listed previously with the MIT license. In comparison, the GPL license requires you to make the source code
available to anyone that obtains it.

## How did the Tetris Movie Shape my Understanding of Software Ownership and Distribution?
- Showed me how complicated and competitive licensing can become (Maxwell and Bulletproof both wanted Tetris rights among other people)
- The cost of licenses is a lot higher than I originally thought (An offer of 1 million dollars up-front was made by Mr. Maxwell | A royalty rate of $1.00 was offered for Tetris)
- Different people can own different rights to the same thing (Arcade, Personal Computer, and Handheld versions of Tetris for example)

## What Surprised or Intrigued Me about NIU's Approach to IP, Patents, and Tech Transfer?
- I was really surprised at how NIU has its own guidelines for IP's and whatnot (If you work for the university, it belongs to NIU, etc)
- The projects mentioned that were worked on at NIU (The braille auto-grader for example)

## How do I think Licensing Empowers or Complicates Open Innovation?
- Licensing empowers open innovation by allowing individuals to patent or copyright something in order for it to be protected, thus allowing them to work on it without the worry of someone stealing the idea or process
- Licensing also complicates open innovation due to the prices of getting a patent or copyright as well as the process that must be completed in order to get those
- Overall, I believe it is a necessary process in order to protect the creation of ideas and inventors, but it unfortunately can discourage some people from doing so due to the previously mentioned reasons

  <summary>BP06 - Global Hack Week Experience</summary>

# What I learned
- How useful GitHub Copilot can be (Can direct you to repositories you are interested in **and** can contribute to)
- The importance of each individual contributor in open-source projects (Each contribution counts no matter how small!)
- The many different ways you can contribute to a project (Documentation, art, websites, optimizing, etc)

# What did I Contribute
Since this event was a livestream showcasing the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, the participants did not contribute much. However, we did communicate through the chat to ask questions and interact with one another which made for a much more welcoming learning environment! I did use their information to test it for myself to see how well Copilot could be used for my interests (*video games mainly*). I ended up finding several repositories (like Excalidraw and SprintRTS) which were both very fascinating!

# Who I Connected With
- The hosts of the event (Three people, one of which had been streaming several of the events for MLH and the other two seemed to be individuals experienced with GitHub Copilot)
- The other participants I interacted with in chat by asking and answering questions (One question asked was "Do any of you use Copilot daily?" to which I replied "Yes, mainly for coding purposes.")

  <summary>BP07 - Explore Non Code Contribution</summary>

# What Counts as a Contribution in Open-Source?
- Documentation
- Code additions/fixes
- Testing/Reviewing
- Anything else that helps a project(Contribution can be seen in plenty of different ways, so don't feel like you can't contribute in some way just because you can't code!)

# My Thoughts on the Value of Code and Non-Code Contributions
## Code
I believe that code contributions are especially important in open-source projects because that's usually what makes the project function. Without the code contributions of many individuals, the project would be unable to run at its current state! Some projects do not require any code at all but that is less common compared to projects that do require code. I don't think that code contributions are *more* important than non-code contributions since every contribution helps the project, but I would say that coding can be seen as a *harder* contribution to do since it does require proficiency in the desired coding language.

## Non-Code
Non-code contributions are **just** as important as code contributions because most projects aren't just code. There has to be documentation for the projects so individuals who look at the project with no context can understand what the project is and how it is meant to be used. Other forms of non-code contributions include art, testing, reviewing, suggestions, and more! Every bit of contribution helps a project towards its end goal of being complete, so I would say that every form has value!

# How does Communication and Collaboration Shape Non-Code Contributions?
Communication and collaboration play a key role in non-code contributions. This is mainly due to the fact that many of the other forms of contribution require creativity(coding does as well but is primarily viewed as a logical "puzzle" to be solved). Working with others to brainstorm and bounce ideas off of each other is best for non-code contributions so different perspectives are taken into account. 

Communication is something that can be applied in almost any project with more than one person working on it because everyone has to be on the same page. Brainstorming, creating road maps, splitting up work, and more can be tasks that absolutely require communication among the members of the project. 

# What Non-Code Contributions did I find?

I found many non-code contributions in [this](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) repository. I found plenty of documentation as well as art and graphics that enhanced the user experience with the project. The suggestions and testing found within the pull requests and issues were also very valuable! Without those issues and pull requests, some of the current features and bugs may have been overlooked!
